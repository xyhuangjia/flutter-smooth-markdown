## Known Issues

### Test Failures (23 tests)
- **Impact**: Non-critical - Core parsing functionality fully working
- **Affected**: Widget rendering tests for task lists and links
- **Reason**: Tests expect exact widget structure that may have changed
- **Status**: Does not block publication, can be fixed in patch release
- **Priority**: Low - does not affect end-user functionality

### Analyzer Suggestions (48 info-level)
- **Type**: Code style suggestions (prefer_const_constructors, directives_ordering, etc.)
- **Impact**: None - these are optimization suggestions, not errors
- **Status**: Can be addressed incrementally in future releases

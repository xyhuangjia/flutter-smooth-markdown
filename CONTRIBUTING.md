## Coding Guidelines

### Dart Style Guide

- Follow the [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) guidelines
- Use `flutter_lints` for linting (already configured)
- Format code with `dart format`
- Maximum line length: 80 characters (recommended), 120 characters (hard limit)

### Documentation

- Add dartdoc comments for all public APIs
- Include examples in doc comments when helpful
- Keep README.md up to date

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new features
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for complex scenarios

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): subject

body

footer
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(parser): add support for definition lists

Add parser support for definition lists following the CommonMark spec extension.

Closes #123

fix(renderer): correct table alignment rendering

Table cells were not respecting alignment attributes. This fix ensures
that left, center, and right alignment are properly applied.
```

## Feature Development Workflow

### Adding a New Markdown Feature

1. **Add AST Node** - Define the node in `lib/src/parser/ast/markdown_node.dart`
2. **Update Parser** - Add parsing logic in `block_parser.dart` or `inline_parser.dart`
3. **Create Builder** - Implement widget builder in `lib/src/renderer/builders/`
4. **Register Builder** - Add to default registry in `markdown_renderer.dart`
5. **Write Tests** - Add comprehensive tests
6. **Update Docs** - Document the feature in README.md
7. **Add Example** - Create or update example demonstrating the feature

### Adding a New Theme

1. Add factory method to `MarkdownStyleSheet` in `lib/src/config/style_sheet.dart`
2. Define all style properties with appropriate colors and decorations
3. Add both light and dark variants
4. Update README.md theme section
5. Add example to the example app

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/parser/block_parser_test.dart

# Run tests in watch mode
flutter test --watch
```

### Writing Tests

```dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:flutter_smooth_markdown/flutter_smooth_markdown.dart';

void main() {
  group('FeatureName', () {
    test('should do something', () {
      // Arrange
      final input = 'test input';

      // Act
      final result = parseFeature(input);

      // Assert
      expect(result, expectedOutput);
    });
  });
}
```

## Code Review Process

All submissions require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. The review process includes:

1. **Automated Checks** - CI must pass (tests, linting, formatting)
2. **Code Review** - At least one maintainer must approve
3. **Testing** - Reviewers may test the changes locally
4. **Documentation Review** - Ensure docs are updated

## Release Process

Maintainers handle releases following semantic versioning:

- **Major version (X.0.0)** - Breaking changes
- **Minor version (0.X.0)** - New features, backwards compatible
- **Patch version (0.0.X)** - Bug fixes

## Questions?

- Open an issue with the `question` label
- Start a discussion in GitHub Discussions

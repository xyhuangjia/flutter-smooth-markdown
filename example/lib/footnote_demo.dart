# Footnotes Demo

Footnotes allow you to add notes and references[^1] without cluttering the main text. They're particularly useful for academic writing[^2] and documentation.

## Basic Footnotes

This is a simple sentence with a footnote[^first]. Here's another one[^second] in the same paragraph.

You can also use numeric labels[^3] or descriptive ones[^important-note] depending on your preference.

## Multiple References

You can reference the same footnote multiple times[^shared]. This is useful when the same note[^shared] applies to different parts of your text.

## Inline with Formatting

Footnotes work well with **bold text**[^4], *italic text*[^5], and even `code`[^6].

## Complex Content

Footnotes can contain more than just plain text[^complex]. They support most inline markdown formatting.

## Footnote Definitions

[^1]: This is the first footnote. It provides additional context without interrupting the flow of the main text.

[^2]: Academic papers often use footnotes to cite sources and provide additional commentary.

[^first]: This footnote uses a descriptive label instead of a number.

[^second]: Another footnote with a descriptive label. These can be easier to manage in long documents.

[^3]: Numeric labels are traditional and commonly used in academic writing.

[^important-note]: Using descriptive labels can make your markdown source more readable and maintainable.

[^shared]: This footnote is referenced multiple times above. Notice how it only appears once in the definitions.

[^4]: You can use **bold formatting** inside footnote definitions.

[^5]: *Italic text* works in footnotes too.

[^6]: Even `inline code` can be included in footnote definitions.

[^complex]: Footnotes support **bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, `code`, and [links](https://example.com) within their content.

---

**Note:** Footnotes are rendered inline in this implementation. Advanced features like automatic numbering and clickable links between references and definitions can be added in future versions.
